			<h1>Changing The Way You Communicate!</h1>
			<p>Our application, the Litter Box, is a somewhat anonymous, open chat tool that allows University of Kentucky students discuss and talk about specific classes, such as ICT 205, as well as specific sections (if the course has multiple sections/multiple instructors).</p>
		</div> 

		<div class="col-lg-1"></div> 

		<div class="col-lg-5">
			<h1>Who exactly is this app for?</h1>
			<p>Our app is mainly focused on UK undergraduate students that are wanting to discuss certain classes in an anonymous style of posting in a fashion that is similar to apps such as YikYak or reddit. The app would allow certain sections of classes to be able to communicate freely with one another and be able to ask questions such as: requests for tutoring, help on an assignment, etc. without having to go through the hassle of remembering student names or complicated student emails. It would also give a chance for students that are no longer in those classes to provide insights on how to do well in the class or how the professor acts/grades.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-lg-5">
				<h1 id="goalsAndDoes">Our Goals and Aims?</h1>
				<p>Our ultimate goal is to be able to connect students in a way that allows for both present and past students to talk about specific classes with one another. Instead of only being able to talk to your fellow/current classmates, like the Canvas messenger, you would be able to talk to any previous student or students that are inquiring about the class for future reference. Anyone and everyone could contribute to the conversation.</p>
			</div> 

			<div class="col-lg-1"></div>

			<div class="col-lg-6">
				<h1 id="goalsAndDoes">What exactly does this app do?</h1>
				<p>Our app is simple: Users will be able to post discussion boards in a forum type style in the specific class and section, i.e. ICT 205 001, and ask questions about the class itself, assignments, the instructor, and everything inbetween. Users will be able to sign up with their UK student email account and create an “anonymous” user name and comment on other posts and make their own. Only those with a valid UK student email will be able to make an account.</p>

			<div class="col-lg-5">
				<h1 id="goalsAndDoes">Features and Functionality</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>Push notifications on followed posts or posts that the user is the original poster of</li>
					<li>Log in to your own personal account that allows you to look at your post history, comments, and interactions</li>
					<li>Be able to send direct messages to a selected user or a set of users
					<li>Forum threads can be hidden or reported for obscene, graphic, or irrelevant material</li>
					<li>A voting system allows important or top rated posts to be at the beginning of the forum thread - Can be filtered (i.e. newest posts first, most popular posts first, etc.)</li> 
				</ul>
			</div> 

			<div class="col-lg-1"></div>

			<div class="col-lg-6">
				<h1 id="goalsAndDoes">Graphic design and user interface</h1>
				<p>Our design is based on the classic forum type site (i.e. reddit, NeoGaf, etc.) where users can post text based discussions and engage with students of classes that they are either in, interested in taking in the future, or have currently been in. The simplistic design and straightforward user interface would allow a lot of content to be showing/present without having issues with information overload (i.e. having a feature that allows for posts to be minimized and comments in threads to be minimized after reading)</p>

						<h3><u>Marvin</u></h3>
						<p>If you&#39;ve ever driven to Louisville Kentucky, chances are you probably passed by my hometown. I was born in a passerby kind of town called Radcliff in Kentucky, where the most fun you can have there is whatever your imagination can put together with a stick and a rock. I go to the University of Kentucky as an ICT major with the intent on pursuing a career in internet security. In my free time I thoroughly enjoy learning code and wasting countless hours on computer gaming, so if you have ever played Overwatch on the PC I&#39ve probably frozen you with Mei on multiple occasions ;P</p>

						<h3><u>Bethany</u></h3>
						<p>From humble beginnings of being grown in the backwoods of central Kentucky in the mid-90s, I am now a senior in ICT with a double minor in Chinese Language and Literature and Economics. My expected graduation date looms closer and closer with each day and I can&#39t even make simple decisions like which flavor of jelly to put on my peanut butter sandwich. Hopefully from the success of our incredible app I will be able to make such hard decisions at the drop of a hat. Or maybe the drop of a paw instead.</p>

						<h3><u>Alex Cornelius</u></h3>
						<p>Born and raised in Western Kentucky I&#39;ve always had dreams of doing big things. The beginning of what I hope to be big things started at the University of Kentucky, I am now a senior with a major in ICT and hope to graduate in December. For the first <q>big thing</q> I plan to do is pour my heart and soul into this application that will allow students to talk trash about their teachers discuss topics from class like never before. This is a game-changer my friends...</p>
