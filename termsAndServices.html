        	<h1 id="TAndC">Terms and Service Agreement</h1>

            <p>Let&#39s be honest, Terms and Conditions statements can be a tricky, heavily debated thing. A lot of companies and developers like to hide what they are taking of your data and what they’re doing with it; we’re not. We will tell you exactly what we will collect, how long we will keep it for, and who can have access to your data.</p>
            <h1>Terms and Conditions statements, what’s that?</h1>
            <p>A terms and conditions statement, also referred to as a terms of service agreement, are a series of rules and regulations that a user promises to abide by in order to use a certain service (i.e. our app, the Litter Box). If a user does not comply with our terms and conditions then they do not get to use our app, simple.</p>
            <h1>Why have a Terms and Conditions statement?</h1>
            <p>These clear cut statements prevent us from any possible liability and suit from users should something happen. They help us product ourselves while also protecting our users!</p>
            <p>For a more in depth look at terms and conditions agreements, check out the Wikipedia page on Terms of Service!</p>
            <h1>Our Terms and Conditions:</h1>
            <p>Our T&C will be broken up into two main categories: proper usage and privacy policy. These categories will explain of what a proper or improper usage of our app is and what data we will be collecting, how long the collected data will be stored, and who all has access to said collected data. The ultimate goal is to provide a T&C that is clear and to the point so our users can understand what’s going on and why.</p>
            <p>So first,</p>
            <h1>What is considered proper usage?</h1> We want our site to be as friendly and as safe as possible where students and staff can come together to talk about our great campus and the daily struggles of classes, professors, and homework. Any comments or posts that are sexually explicit, refer to illegal activities, or target a specific group in a negative way (i.e. a racist or homophobic post/comment) will be immediately banned by our moderators and, if required, the user’s identity and account will be forfeited to proper authorities for failing to abide by these rules.
            <h1>A user does not have the right to plead that their information cannot be given over to proper, official authorities if a breach of the T&C occurs.</h1>
            <h1>A proper usage, in our terms, is simply this: <span id="underline">don’t be a dick.</span></h1>
            <h1>Post freely but remember societal limits and our rules.</h1>
            <p>Any and all posts are made “public” to account holders and that should be kept in mind before posting.</p>
            <p>If your comment/post/account is banned and you do not understand why or would like to argue the ban, contact us and we will look into the situation. Unbanning can potentially happen on a case to case basis but don’t count on it. If you or your comment/post was banned there was probably a sound reason for it. Nevertheless, we will accept ban appeals.
            </p>
            <h1>What data will we require?</h1>
            <p>We will require a valid @uky.edu email address, either staff or student. The Gmail and Live Mail equivalents will also be accepted.</p>
            <p>Your email will not be shared to third parties if it contains your full name.</p>
            <p>Most of the data we ask for is optional (i.e. gender, age, graduation date, credit card information for premium account, etc.). We only really require a valid @uky.edu and full name (first and last name). Your name will not be shared to third parties for advertising purposes but it is required in case a T&C breach occurs and requires action. Any user that is found providing a false name will be banned due to a breach of the T&C.</p>
            <h1>What will we track?</h1>
            <p>Geo-location tracking is a feature available for our app to determine if you are on campus or not. If a user is on campus while using the Litter Box, a more personalized experience is had and will show you how many users are currently online at the university. This can be managed in the settings of the app and turned off, but if utilized, Litter Box will track your location only while it registers on university grounds.</p>
            <p>Usage statistics will also be tracked and, like the geo-location, can be turned off if needed. These usage statistics will only be used in order to see what people are primarily using the app for and where improvements can be made.</p>
            <p>A user does have a right to their privacy and can turn these tracking</p>
            <h1>How long we will have this data?</h1>
            <p>After an account is made we will hold your data for eight years for students (the foreseeable maximum time for a student to be in a collegiate society) and indefinitely for staff.A staff’s data will only be deleted if they either directly request it or leave the university.A student’s data will be deleted after the eight years or with a direct request for deletion.</p>
            <p>If a student or staff member would like their data removed an official request for removal must be completed. After a request is filed and completed none of the information can be feasibly recovered.</p>
            <p>If an account has been banned or investigated the data of that account will be held indefinitely regardless if student or staff.</p>
            <h1>Who has access to this data?</h1>
            <p>Your sensitive information (i.e. email, account login, full name, etc.) will be managed by us and our moderators only. Should a user break the T&C and require intervention from an outside source (i.e. campus police, Dean of Students, etc.), the rights of the user are given up and that information is free to be given to the property authorities.</p>
			<h1>Additional information:</h1>
			<p>If a user is confused about whether or not they are willing to agree to the T&C they should probably should not create an account.</p>
			<p>Our T&C is very clear and any breaches will be taken seriously so please remember:
			<p> <h1>We have the explicit right to delete, alter, or give up a user’s data if a breach of contract occurs.</h1>
